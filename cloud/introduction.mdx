description: Learn about Tuist Cloud services that enhance your development workflow
---

Tuist Cloud is a suite of services designed to accelerate your iOS and macOS development workflow. By integrating seamlessly with the Tuist CLI, these services provide caching, insights, preview distribution, and more.

## Why Tuist Cloud?

Building and testing large iOS projects can be time-consuming. Tuist Cloud addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Faster builds** through intelligent binary caching
- **Actionable insights** from build and test analytics
- **Seamless distribution** of preview builds to QA teams
- **Bundle analysis** to track and optimize app size
- **Swift package registry** for internal dependency management

## How It Works

Tuist Cloud services are accessed through the Tuist CLI. When you run commands like `tuist cache warm` or `tuist build`, the CLI communicates with Tuist Cloud to:

- **Upload** build artifacts and analytics data
- **Download** cached binaries to speed up builds
- **Store** preview builds for distribution
- **Collect** metrics about your project's health

All communication is secured with authentication tokens and happens transparently in the background.

## Architecture

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Tuist CLI] --> B[Tuist Cloud]
    B --> C[Cache Service]
    B --> D[Previews Service]
    B --> E[Analytics Service]
    B --> F[Registry Service]
    C --> G[S3 Storage]
    D --> G
    E --> H[ClickHouse DB]
    F --> G
```

The CLI acts as the primary interface to cloud services, handling authentication, data upload/download, and providing feedback on operations.

## Self-Hosting

Tuist Cloud can be self-hosted if you prefer to run the infrastructure yourself. The server is built with Elixir/Phoenix and uses:

- **PostgreSQL** for primary data storage
- **ClickHouse** for analytics data
- **S3-compatible storage** for artifacts

For more information about self-hosting, visit the [Tuist server repository](https://github.com/tuist/tuist).
