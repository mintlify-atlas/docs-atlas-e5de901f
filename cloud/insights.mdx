Tuist Insights provides analytics and visualization of your build and test data, helping you identify performance bottlenecks, track trends, and make data-driven decisions to improve your development workflow.

## Overview

Insights collect and analyze data from:

- **Build runs**: Duration, success rate, file compilation times
- **Cache operations**: Hit rates, download/upload times
- **Test runs**: Pass/fail rates, test duration, flaky tests
- **Bundle sizes**: App size trends, asset analysis
- **CAS operations**: Content-addressable storage metrics

```

## Prerequisites

1. [Authenticate with Tuist Cloud](/cloud/authentication)
2. Configure your project:

```swift Config.swift
import ProjectDescription

let config = Config(
    cloud: .cloud(
        url: "https://cloud.tuist.io",
        projectId: "your-org/your-project"
    )
)
```

Insights are automatically collected when you use Tuist Cloud services. No additional setup is required.

## Build Insights

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Data

If insights aren't showing:

1. Verify authentication: `tuist auth whoami`
2. Check project configuration in `Config.swift`
3. Ensure commands are running with cloud enabled

### Incorrect Metrics

If data seems wrong:

1. Verify system time is correct
2. Check for duplicate builds in CI
3. Review git metadata accuracy

### Dashboard Performance

If the dashboard is slow:

1. Reduce date range
2. Filter by specific targets or tests
3. Use aggregated views instead of raw data
