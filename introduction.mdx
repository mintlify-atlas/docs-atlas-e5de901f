## Why Tuist?

Swift app development comes with challenges that slow teams down:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Xcode project complexity" icon="diagram-project">
    Large Xcode projects become difficult to maintain, merge, and understand as teams grow. Tuist's generated projects define your project structure in readable Swift code, making it version-control friendly and reducing merge conflicts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Slow build times" icon="clock">
    As projects grow, build times increase exponentially. Tuist's caching solution stores pre-built binaries and reuses them across local and CI environments, dramatically reducing build times.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Inefficient testing" icon="vial">
    Running your entire test suite on every change wastes time. Tuist's selective testing intelligently determines which tests are affected by your changes, running only what's necessary.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Manual app distribution" icon="share-nodes">
    Sharing builds with stakeholders requires manual work and infrastructure. Tuist Previews makes it as simple as sharing a link.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Lack of visibility" icon="eye-slash">
    Understanding build performance and identifying bottlenecks is difficult. Tuist provides detailed insights and analytics to help you make informed decisions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
