## Prerequisites

  <Card icon="apple" title="macOS">
    macOS 12.0 or later (for Xcode projects)
  </Card>
  <Card icon="hammer" title="Xcode">
    Xcode 14.0 or later installed
  </Card>
  <Card icon="cube" title="Swift">

<Note>
  Tuist also runs on Linux for commands that don't require Xcode, such as authentication, project management, and analytics.
</Note>

## Step 1: Install Tuist

The recommended way to install Tuist is using [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev), a versatile development tool version manager:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Install Mise (Homebrew)
brew install mise
```

```bash Install Mise (curl)
curl https://mise.run | sh
```

</CodeGroup>

Once Mise is installed, you can run Tuist commands directly:

```bash Run Tuist via Mise
mise x tuist@latest -- tuist init
```

For persistent installation in your project:

```bash Install Tuist in project
cd your-project
mise use tuist@latest
```

This creates a `.mise.toml` file that pins the Tuist version for your project, ensuring all team members use the same version.

<Tip>
  See the [Installation guide](/installation) for other installation methods including direct download and building from source.
</Tip>

## Step 2: Initialize your project

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="New project">
    Create a new project from scratch with Tuist's interactive setup:

    ```bash Create new project
    tuist init
    ```

    The interactive CLI will guide you through:

    1. **Authentication**: Log in to Tuist Cloud (free tier available)
    2. **Project type**: Choose to create a generated project
    3. **Project name**: Enter your app name
    4. **Platform**: Select iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, or visionOS
    5. **Organization**: Choose or create an organization

    <Accordion title="What gets created?">
      Tuist generates a complete project structure:

      ```
      YourApp/
      ├── Project.swift          # Project manifest
      ├── Config.swift           # Tuist configuration (optional)
      ├── YourApp/
      │   ├── Sources/          # Source files
      │   │   └── ContentView.swift
      │   └── Resources/        # Assets and resources
      │       └── Assets.xcassets
      ├── .mise.toml            # Tuist version pinning
      └── .gitignore            # Ignores generated files
      ```

      - **Project.swift**: Swift-based project definition
      - **Sources/**: Your application code
      - **Resources/**: Assets, storyboards, and other resources
    </Accordion>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Existing Xcode project">
    If you have an existing Xcode project, Tuist can integrate with it:

    ```bash Initialize in existing project
    cd your-existing-project
    tuist init
    ```

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Select workflow">
        Choose "Integrate with existing Xcode project" when prompted
      </Step>
      <Step title="Select project">
        Tuist detects your `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` files
      </Step>
      <Step title="Configure integration">
        Connect to Tuist Cloud for caching and insights
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    <Warning>
      For migrating an existing Xcode project to a generated project, see the [migration guide](/guides/migrate-from-xcode) for detailed steps.
    </Warning>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Generate and build

Once your project is set up, generate the Xcode project:

```bash Generate Xcode project
tuist generate
```

This command:
- Reads your `Project.swift` manifest
- Resolves dependencies
- Generates an `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace`
- Opens it in Xcode (unless you use `--no-open`)

<CodeGroup>

```bash Generate and open
tuist generate
```

```bash Generate without opening
tuist generate --no-open
```

```bash Clean and regenerate
tuist clean && tuist generate
```

</CodeGroup>

### Build your project

You can build using Xcode or directly from the command line:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Build with Tuist
tuist build
```

```bash Build specific scheme
tuist build MyApp
```

```bash Build and run
tuist build MyApp && tuist run MyApp
```

</CodeGroup>

### Run tests

```bash Run all tests
tuist test
```

```bash Run specific test target
tuist test MyAppTests
```

<Tip>
  Use `tuist test --help` to see all testing options including selective testing.
</Tip>

## Step 4: Explore features

Now that you have a working project, explore Tuist's powerful features:

### Cache for faster builds

Enable caching to speed up your builds:

```swift Config.swift
import ProjectDescription

let config = Config(
    cache: .cache(
        profiles: [
            .profile(name: "Development", configuration: "Debug")
        ]
    )
)
```

Warm the cache:

```bash
tuist cache warm
```

</Card>

### Visualize your project graph

Understand your project's dependencies:

```bash Generate dependency graph
tuist graph
```

This opens an interactive visualization showing:
- Target dependencies
- External packages
- Dependency relationships

### Share previews

Share your app with stakeholders:

```bash Share app preview
tuist share MyApp
```

This uploads your app and provides a shareable link that anyone can use to install the app on their device.

## Understanding the Project.swift manifest

Your `Project.swift` file defines your project structure:

```swift Project.swift
import ProjectDescription

let project = Project(
    name: "MyApp",
    targets: [
        .target(
            name: "MyApp",
            destinations: .iOS,
            product: .app,
            bundleId: "com.company.myapp",
            deploymentTargets: .iOS("16.0"),
            infoPlist: .default,
            sources: ["MyApp/Sources/**"],
            resources: ["MyApp/Resources/**"],
            dependencies: []
        ),
        .target(
            name: "MyAppTests",
            destinations: .iOS,
            product: .unitTests,
            bundleId: "com.company.myapp.tests",
            sources: ["MyAppTests/Sources/**"],
            dependencies: [
                .target(name: "MyApp")
            ]
        )
    ]
)
```
