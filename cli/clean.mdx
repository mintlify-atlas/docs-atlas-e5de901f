## Overview

The `tuist clean` command removes cached artifacts from your local machine and optionally from remote storage. This helps reclaim disk space and resolve issues caused by corrupted or outdated cache files.

## Usage

```bash
tuist clean [categories...] [options]
```

## Arguments

<ParamField path="categories" type="string[]">
  The cache and artifact categories to clean. If no category is specified, everything is cleaned. Available categories:
  
  - `plugins` - Cached plugins
  - `generatedAutomationProjects` - Projects generated for automation tasks
  - `projectDescriptionHelpers` - Project description helpers cache
  - `manifests` - Manifests cache
  - `editProjects` - Temporary edit projects cache
  - `runs` - Tuist runs cache
  - `binaries` - Cached binary frameworks
  - `selectiveTests` - Selective testing cache
  - `dependencies` - Swift Package Manager build directory
</ParamField>

## Options

<ParamField path="--remote" type="boolean" default="false">
  Clean the remote cache stored on Tuist Cloud. This removes cached binaries from the server.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--path" type="string" default=".">
  The path to the directory that contains the project to clean.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-p" type="string">
  Short form of `--path`.
</ParamField>

## Examples

### Clean all local artifacts

```bash
tuist clean
```

Removes all cached artifacts from your local machine.

### Clean specific categories

```bash
tuist clean binaries manifests
```

Removes only cached binaries and manifests.

### Clean plugin cache

```bash
tuist clean plugins
```

Removes the plugins cache, useful when updating plugin versions.

### Clean dependencies build directory

```bash
tuist clean dependencies
```

Removes the Swift Package Manager `.build` directory at the root of your project.

### Clean remote cache

```bash
tuist clean --remote
```

Cleans both local artifacts and removes cached binaries from Tuist Cloud.

### Clean specific category with path

```bash
tuist clean binaries --path ~/Projects/MyApp
```

Cleans binaries cache for a project at a specific location.

## When to use clean

You might want to run `tuist clean` when:

- **Freeing disk space**: Cache directories can grow large over time
- **Resolving cache issues**: Corrupted or outdated cache files causing build problems
- **After major changes**: When switching between significantly different branches or project states
- **Plugin updates**: After updating or removing plugins to clear stale plugin cache
- **Remote cache issues**: Use `--remote` to clear problematic cached binaries from Tuist Cloud

<Note>
  Cleaning local cache is safe and reversible - artifacts will be regenerated or re-downloaded as needed. However, cleaning remote cache with `--remote` removes shared cached binaries for your entire team.
