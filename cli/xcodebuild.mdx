## Overview

The `tuist xcodebuild` command extends Apple's xcodebuild CLI with server capabilities such as selective testing, build analytics, and insights. It provides the same interface as xcodebuild while adding powerful features from Tuist Cloud.

All standard xcodebuild arguments are passed through, so you can use it as a drop-in replacement.

## Usage

```bash
tuist xcodebuild <action> [xcodebuild-arguments...]
```

## Subcommands

### `tuist xcodebuild test`

Runs tests with insights and analytics.

```bash
tuist xcodebuild test [xcodebuild-arguments...]
```

All arguments are passed through to xcodebuild's `test` action.

#### Example

```bash
tuist xcodebuild test -scheme MyAppTests -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' -parallel-testing-enabled YES
```

### `tuist xcodebuild test-without-building`

Runs tests without building first, with insights.

```bash
tuist xcodebuild test-without-building [xcodebuild-arguments...]
```

All arguments are passed through to xcodebuild's `test-without-building` action.

#### Example

```bash
tuist xcodebuild test-without-building -scheme MyAppTests -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' -testConfiguration Debug
```

### `tuist xcodebuild build`

Builds with insights and analytics.

```bash
tuist xcodebuild build [xcodebuild-arguments...]
```

All arguments are passed through to xcodebuild's `build` action.

#### Example

```bash
tuist xcodebuild build -scheme MyApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```

### `tuist xcodebuild build-for-testing`

Builds for testing with insights.

```bash
tuist xcodebuild build-for-testing [xcodebuild-arguments...]
```

All arguments are passed through to xcodebuild's `build-for-testing` action.

#### Example

```bash
tuist xcodebuild build-for-testing -scheme MyAppTests -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```

### `tuist xcodebuild archive`

Creates an archive with insights.

```bash
tuist xcodebuild archive [xcodebuild-arguments...]
```

All arguments are passed through to xcodebuild's `archive` action.

#### Example

```bash
tuist xcodebuild archive -scheme MyApp -archivePath ./build/MyApp.xcarchive
```

## Server capabilities

When connected to Tuist Cloud, `tuist xcodebuild` provides:

### Selective testing

Automatically runs only tests affected by code changes, significantly reducing test execution time. The command:

1. Hashes your project's targets and dependencies
2. Compares against cached test results on the server
3. Runs only tests for changed code
4. Uploads new test results for future runs

This works automatically for unit tests when using `tuist xcodebuild test`.

### Build analytics

Collects and uploads build metrics including:

- Build duration and status
- Compilation times per target
- Error and warning counts
- Device and configuration information
- Test results and coverage

Analytics are viewable in the Tuist Cloud dashboard.

### Insights

Provides intelligent insights into your builds:

- Performance bottlenecks
- Flaky test detection
- Build time trends
- Error patterns

## Drop-in replacement

Replace `xcodebuild` with `tuist xcodebuild` in your existing scripts and CI workflows:

**Before:**
```bash
xcodebuild test -scheme MyApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```

**After:**
```bash
tuist xcodebuild test -scheme MyApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```

All xcodebuild options, flags, and arguments work exactly the same way.

## CI integration

Use `tuist xcodebuild` in your CI pipelines to get insights and selective testing:

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
- name: Run tests
  run: |
    tuist xcodebuild test \
      -scheme MyApp \
      -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```

### GitLab CI

```yaml
test:
  script:
    - tuist xcodebuild test -scheme MyApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'
```

### Jenkins

```groovy
stage('Test') {
  steps {
    sh 'tuist xcodebuild test -scheme MyApp -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15"'
  }
}
```

## Authentication

To use server capabilities, authenticate with Tuist Cloud:

```bash
tuist auth
```

Or set the `TUIST_CONFIG_TOKEN` environment variable in CI.

## Examples

### Basic test run

```bash
tuist xcodebuild test -scheme MyAppTests
```

### Test with specific device

```bash
tuist xcodebuild test \
  -scheme MyAppTests \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15 Pro'
```

### Build for multiple destinations

```bash
tuist xcodebuild build \
  -scheme MyApp \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPad Pro (12.9-inch)'
```

### Archive for distribution

```bash
tuist xcodebuild archive \
  -scheme MyApp \
  -archivePath ./build/MyApp.xcarchive \
  -configuration Release
```

### Test with parallel execution

```bash
tuist xcodebuild test \
  -scheme MyAppTests \
  -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15' \
  -parallel-testing-enabled YES
```

## Limitations

- **Selective testing**: Currently only works for unit tests (not UI tests)
- **Analytics**: Requires authentication with Tuist Cloud
- **Network**: Requires internet connection to upload analytics
