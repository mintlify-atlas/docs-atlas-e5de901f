## Overview

The `tuist edit` command generates a temporary Xcode project that allows you to edit your Tuist manifest files (`Project.swift`, `Workspace.swift`, etc.) with full IDE support including syntax highlighting, autocomplete, and type checking.

## Usage

```bash
tuist edit [options]
```

## Options

<ParamField path="--path" type="string" default=".">
  The path to the directory whose project will be edited.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-p" type="string">
  Short form of `--path`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--permanent" type="boolean" default="false">
  Creates the project in the current directory or the one indicated by `-p` and doesn't block the process. By default, the project is temporary and the command blocks until you close Xcode.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-P" type="boolean">
  Short form of `--permanent`.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="--only-current-directory" type="boolean" default="false">
  Only includes the manifest in the current directory. By default, manifests from parent directories and helpers are included.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-o" type="boolean">
  Short form of `--only-current-directory`.
</ParamField>

## Examples

### Edit manifests with Xcode

```bash
tuist edit
```

Generates a temporary Xcode project, opens it, and waits. When you close Xcode, the temporary project is automatically cleaned up.

### Edit in background

```bash
tuist edit --permanent
```

Generates an Xcode project in the current directory and returns immediately. The project file remains after closing Xcode.

### Edit only current directory

```bash
tuist edit --only-current-directory
```

Creates a project that only includes the manifest files in the current directory, excluding parent manifests and helpers.

### Edit from specific path

```bash
tuist edit --path ~/Projects/MyApp
```

Edits the manifests for a project at a specific location.

### Permanent project in custom location

```bash
tuist edit --permanent --path Features/Login
```

Creates a permanent edit project for manifests in the `Features/Login` directory.

## How it works

When you run `tuist edit`, Tuist:

1. **Scans for manifests**: Finds all relevant manifest files (`.swift` files in the project)
2. **Includes helpers**: Adds any `ProjectDescriptionHelpers` modules for autocomplete
3. **Generates Xcode project**: Creates a simple Xcode project structure
4. **Opens in Xcode**: Launches Xcode with the generated project
5. **Waits (default)**: Blocks until you close Xcode, then cleans up temporary files

## What's included

The edit project includes:

- All manifest files (`Project.swift`, `Workspace.swift`, `Tuist.swift`, etc.)
- `ProjectDescriptionHelpers` modules with custom extensions
- Parent directory manifests (unless `--only-current-directory` is used)
- The `ProjectDescription` framework for autocomplete and type checking

## Use cases

### IDE support for manifests

Get full Xcode IDE features when editing manifest files:

- Syntax highlighting
- Code completion
- Type checking
- Quick documentation
- Jump to definition
- Error highlighting

### Working with helpers

Easily navigate and edit `ProjectDescriptionHelpers`:

```bash
tuist edit
```

You can jump between manifest files and helper modules with full IDE support.

### Quick manifest fixes

When you need to make complex changes to manifests:

```bash
tuist edit
# Make changes in Xcode with full IDE support
# Close Xcode when done
```

### Persistent edit project

Keep a permanent edit project alongside your code:

```bash
tuist edit --permanent
# The .xcodeproj remains for future editing
```

Add `Manifests.xcodeproj` to your `.gitignore` if using this approach.

<Warning>
  The edit project is for editing manifests only. It's not the same as your generated Xcode workspace from `tuist generate`. Use `tuist generate` to work on your actual application code.
</Warning>

<Tip>
  If you frequently edit manifests, consider using `--permanent` and adding the generated project to your `.gitignore`. This gives you persistent IDE support without regenerating each time.
</Tip>
