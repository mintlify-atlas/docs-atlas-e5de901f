## Overview

The `tuist setup` command provides subcommands to configure various Tuist services and features in your development environment.

## Usage

```bash
tuist setup <subcommand> [options]
```

## Subcommands

### `tuist setup cache`

Sets up the Tuist Xcode cache for your project. This command prepares your project to use Tuist's binary caching capabilities, which can significantly speed up build times.

```bash
tuist setup cache [options]
```

#### Options

<ParamField path="--path" type="string" default=".">
  The path to the directory or a subdirectory of the project.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="-p" type="string">
  Short form of `--path`.
</ParamField>

#### Example

```bash
tuist setup cache
```

Sets up binary caching for the project in the current directory.

```bash
tuist setup cache --path ~/Projects/MyApp
```

Sets up binary caching for a project in a specific directory.

## Cache setup

The cache setup process:

1. **Validates project structure**: Ensures your project is compatible with caching
2. **Configures cache settings**: Sets up necessary cache configurations
3. **Prepares storage**: Initializes local or remote cache storage
4. **Generates metadata**: Creates cache-related metadata files

### Benefits of cache setup

- **Faster builds**: Reuse pre-compiled binaries instead of rebuilding unchanged targets
- **Reduced CI time**: Share cache artifacts across CI runs and developers
- **Better iteration speed**: Focus on changed code while using cached dependencies
- **Team collaboration**: Share cache artifacts with your team through Tuist Cloud

### Cache profiles

After setting up cache, you can use different cache profiles:

- **simulator**: Cache for simulator architectures
- **device**: Cache for device architectures  
- **all**: Cache for all architectures
- **none**: Disable caching
- **Custom profiles**: Define your own in `Tuist.swift`

## Related commands

Once cache is set up, use these commands to work with the cache:

- **Cache warming**: `tuist cache` - Pre-populate the cache
- **Generation with cache**: `tuist generate --cache-profile simulator`
- **Building with cache**: `tuist build` (automatically uses cache)
