## Overview

`Workspace.swift` is an optional manifest file that defines an Xcode workspace containing multiple projects. By default, `tuist generate` creates a workspace automatically, but you can use `Workspace.swift` to customize which projects are included and how they're organized.

## Location

Place `Workspace.swift` at the root of your repository or in the directory where you want to generate the workspace:

```
/Workspace.swift         # Generates Workspace.xcworkspace
/Tuist.swift            # Configuration
/App/Project.swift      # Individual projects
/Framework/Project.swift
/Shared/Project.swift
```

## When to use Workspace.swift

Use `Workspace.swift` when you need to:

- Include multiple independent projects in a single workspace
- Add documentation files to the workspace
- Define custom workspace-level schemes
- Organize projects that don't have dependencies between them
- Control the exact structure of the generated workspace

## Basic structure

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let workspace = Workspace(
    name: "MyWorkspace",
    projects: ["Projects/**"]
)
```

## Properties

### name

<ParamField path="name" type="String" required>
  The name of the workspace. Also used as the file name of the generated Xcode workspace (e.g., `MyWorkspace.xcworkspace`).
</ParamField>

### projects

<ParamField path="projects" type="[Path]" required>
  The paths (or glob patterns) to project manifest directories. Tuist will look for `Project.swift` files in these locations.
</ParamField>

### schemes

<ParamField path="schemes" type="[Scheme]" default="[]">
  Custom workspace-level schemes. Default schemes for each target are generated automatically by default.
</ParamField>

### fileHeaderTemplate

<ParamField path="fileHeaderTemplate" type="FileHeaderTemplate?" default="nil">
  The custom file header template for Xcode built-in file templates, applied to all projects in the workspace.
</ParamField>

### additionalFiles

<ParamField path="additionalFiles" type="[FileElement]" default="[]">
  Additional files to include in the workspace (e.g., documentation, README files) that aren't part of any specific project.
</ParamField>

### generationOptions

<ParamField path="generationOptions" type="GenerationOptions" default=".options()">
  Options that control workspace generation behavior.
</ParamField>

## Examples

### Simple workspace

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let workspace = Workspace(
    name: "MyWorkspace",
    projects: [
        "App",
        "Framework",
        "SharedKit"
    ]
)
```

### With glob patterns

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let workspace = Workspace(
    name: "MyWorkspace",
    projects: [
        "Projects/**",
        "Features/**",
        "Frameworks/**"
    ]
)
```

This includes all `Project.swift` files found in the `Projects`, `Features`, and `Frameworks` directories and their subdirectories.

### With additional files

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let workspace = Workspace(
    name: "MyWorkspace",
    projects: ["Projects/**"],
    additionalFiles: [
        "README.md",
        "CONTRIBUTING.md",
        "Documentation/**",
        .folderReference(path: "Scripts")
    ]
)
```

### With custom schemes

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let workspace = Workspace(
    name: "MyWorkspace",
    projects: ["Projects/**"],
    schemes: [
        Scheme(
            name: "All-Tests",
            shared: true,
            buildAction: .buildAction(targets: ["App", "Framework"]),
            testAction: .targets(["AppTests", "FrameworkTests"])
        ),
        Scheme(
            name: "All-Apps",
            shared: true,
            buildAction: .buildAction(targets: ["App", "WatchApp", "TVApp"])
        )
    ]
)
```

### With file header template

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let workspace = Workspace(
    name: "MyWorkspace",
    projects: ["Projects/**"],
    fileHeaderTemplate: .string(
        """
        //
        //  ___FILENAME___
        //  ___PACKAGENAME___
        //
        //  Created by ___FULLUSERNAME___ on ___DATE___.
        //  Copyright © ___YEAR___ ___ORGANIZATIONNAME___. All rights reserved.
        //
        """
    )
)
```

### With generation options

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let workspace = Workspace(
    name: "MyWorkspace",
    projects: ["Projects/**"],
    generationOptions: .options(
        resolveDependenciesWithSystemScm: false,
        disablePackageVersionLocking: false
    )
)
```

## Project organization patterns

### Feature-based organization

```
/Workspace.swift
/Features/
  /Login/Project.swift
  /Dashboard/Project.swift
  /Settings/Project.swift
/Core/
  /Networking/Project.swift
  /Database/Project.swift
```

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let workspace = Workspace(
    name: "App",
    projects: [
        "Features/**",
        "Core/**"
    ]
)
```

### Layer-based organization

```
/Workspace.swift
/Apps/
  /iOS/Project.swift
  /macOS/Project.swift
/Frameworks/
  /UI/Project.swift
  /Core/Project.swift
/Tests/
  /IntegrationTests/Project.swift
```

```swift
import ProjectDescription

let workspace = Workspace(
    name: "MyWorkspace",
    projects: [
        "Apps/**",
        "Frameworks/**",
        "Tests/**"
    ]
)
```

## Workspace schemes

Workspace schemes allow you to define build and test actions that span multiple projects:

```swift
Scheme(
    name: "All-Features",
    shared: true,
    buildAction: .buildAction(
        targets: [
            "LoginFeature",
            "DashboardFeature",
            "SettingsFeature"
        ]
    ),
    testAction: .targets([
        "LoginTests",
        "DashboardTests",
        "SettingsTests"
    ]),
    runAction: .runAction(
        executable: "App"
    )
)
```

## Best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Glob patterns" icon="asterisk">
    Use glob patterns to automatically include new projects without updating the workspace manifest.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Documentation" icon="book">
    Include documentation files in `additionalFiles` to make them easily accessible in Xcode.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Shared schemes" icon="share-nodes">
    Create workspace-level schemes for common operations like running all tests or building multiple apps.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistent structure" icon="folder-tree">
    Organize projects in a clear directory structure that matches your team's mental model.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Default behavior without Workspace.swift

If you don't create a `Workspace.swift` file, Tuist automatically:

1. Finds all `Project.swift` files in the current directory and subdirectories
2. Generates a workspace with the name of the current directory
3. Includes all discovered projects in the workspace

For simple projects or monorepos with a flat structure, this default behavior may be sufficient.
