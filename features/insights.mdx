    - **Misses**: Required full rebuild
    
    ```
    Local:  45% (↑↑↑ 242 targets)
    Remote: 42% (↓↓  228 targets)  
    Miss:   13% (↓    71 targets)
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Latency">
    Read and write performance:
    - P50, P90, P99 latencies

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Storage">
    Cache storage metrics:
    - Total cache size

    - Compression ratios
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Build Comparison

Compare builds to measure improvements:

### Before/After Optimization

```bash
# Run baseline build
tuist build

# Make optimizations
# ...

# Run comparison build
tuist build
```

View side-by-side comparison in dashboard:

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|--------|
| Duration | 5m 23s | 2m 18s | 🚀 -57% |
| Cache Hits | 45% | 89% | ↑ +44% |
| Compiled Files | 315 | 34 | ↓ -89% |

### Branch Comparison

Compare feature branch builds against main:

- Build time regression detection
- Cache performance changes
- New warnings introduced
- Compilation overhead

## Custom Analytics

### Tags and Labels

Organize builds with custom metadata:

```bash
# Tag builds by feature
tuist build --tag feature:payments

# Label by environment  
tuist build --tag env:staging

# Add custom metadata
tuist build --custom-values ci:github run:1234
```

Filter and analyze by tags in the dashboard.

### CI Provider Integration
