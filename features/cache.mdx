title: Binary Caching
description: Speed up your builds with intelligent binary caching
---

Tuist's binary caching feature dramatically reduces build times by caching framework and library binaries, allowing you to reuse previously built artifacts instead of recompiling everything from scratch.

## Overview

Binary caching works by:
- **Computing content hashes** for your targets based on source files, dependencies, and build configuration
- **Storing compiled binaries** in local or remote storage
- **Replacing targets** with their cached binaries when the content hasn't changed
- **Warming the cache** in CI to speed up local development

<Info>
  Tuist intelligently determines which targets are cacheable. Only frameworks, static frameworks, bundles, and macros are eligible for caching.
</Info>

## How It Works

### Content Hashing

Tuist generates a unique hash for each target based on:

1. **Source files** - All Swift, Objective-C, and resource files
2. **Dependencies** - Both direct and transitive dependencies
3. **Build settings** - Configuration, Swift version, and compiler flags
4. **Cache version** - Tuist's cache version to invalidate incompatible artifacts

```swift
// Automatically excluded from cache:
// - Targets that depend on XCTest
// - Excluded targets you specify
// - Non-cacheable product types (apps, tests)
```

### Cache Storage

Tuist supports two storage options:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Local Cache" icon="laptop">
    Fast, disk-based cache stored on your machine. Perfect for individual developers.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Remote Cache" icon="cloud">
    Shared cache stored in Tuist Cloud. Enables team-wide cache sharing and CI/CD acceleration.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Getting Started

### Enable Binary Cache

By default, binary caching is enabled for all Tuist projects. To use it:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate with cache">
    Run your project with caching enabled:
    ```bash
    tuist generate
    ```
    
    The first generation will build everything and populate the cache.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Build your project">
    Build your project in Xcode. Tuist will cache the compiled frameworks.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Clean and regenerate">
    ```bash
    tuist clean
    tuist generate
    ```
    
    Watch as Tuist restores cached binaries instead of recompiling!
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Warm the Cache in CI

Speed up CI builds by pre-building and caching frameworks:

```bash
# In your CI script
tuist cache warm
```

This builds all cacheable targets and stores them for future runs.

## Remote Caching

Share cache artifacts across your team using Tuist Cloud.

### Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Authenticate">
    ```bash
    tuist auth
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Link your project">
    ```bash
    tuist project create
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use remote cache">
    Tuist automatically uses remote cache when authenticated. No additional configuration needed!
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Remote cache is transparent. Tuist checks the remote cache first, falls back to local cache, and finally rebuilds if necessary.
</Tip>

## Configuration

### Exclude Targets from Cache

Some targets shouldn't be cached (e.g., frequently changing code):

```bash
tuist generate --no-cache
```

Or exclude specific targets when warming the cache:

```bash
tuist cache warm --exclude TargetName
```

### Disable Binary Cache

If you need to build everything from source:

```bash
tuist build --no-binary-cache
tuist test --no-binary-cache
```

## Cache Invalidation

The cache is automatically invalidated when:

- **Source files change** - Any modification to Swift, Objective-C, or resource files
- **Dependencies change** - Updates to SPM packages, CocoaPods, or local dependencies
- **Build settings change** - Configuration, compiler flags, or Swift version updates
- **Cache version bumps** - Tuist updates that change the cache format

<Warning>
  Clean builds ignore the cache. Use `tuist clean` to force rebuilding all targets.
</Warning>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Structure your project for caching" icon="sitemap">
    - Break your app into multiple frameworks
    - Separate stable code from frequently changing code
    - Use explicit dependencies instead of implicit ones
    - Keep framework interfaces stable
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Optimize CI builds" icon="rocket">
    - Run `tuist cache warm` as the first step in CI
    - Cache the `~/.tuist/Cache` directory between CI runs
    - Use remote cache to share artifacts across CI jobs
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Debug cache issues" icon="bug">
    Check if a target is being cached:
    ```bash
    tuist cache
    ```
    
    Clear local cache:
    ```bash
    rm -rf ~/.tuist/Cache
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Performance Impact

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="First Build" icon="clock">
    Standard build time
    
    No cache available
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cached Build" icon="bolt">
    **70-90% faster**
    
    Only changed targets rebuild
  </Card>
  <Card title="Full Cache" icon="rocket">
    **95%+ faster**
    
    No compilation needed
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Cache not being used" icon="circle-question">
    - Verify `tuist generate` completed successfully
    - Check if targets are cacheable (frameworks, not apps)
    - Ensure you're not using `--no-cache` flag
    - Verify remote authentication with `tuist auth`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Outdated cache artifacts" icon="clock-rotate-left">
    - Run `tuist clean` to clear local cache
    - Verify source files are properly tracked in git
    - Check for uncommitted changes that affect hashing
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Remote cache upload failures" icon="cloud-xmark">
    - Verify network connectivity
    - Check authentication status
    - Ensure project is properly linked to Tuist Cloud
